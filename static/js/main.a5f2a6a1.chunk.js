My name is Michael Montagnese. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website! I am a computer engineer currently studying at Queen's University located in Kingston, ON. Technology has been a primary interest of mine for as long as I can remember. I have been taking computer programming courses since high school and have continued to pursue this interest. I have concentrated on software engineering which includes topics such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelegence, Software Performance, and Quality Assurance. During my studies I have learned many core features for developing software such as implementation techniques for testing, website and mobile app creation and deployment, and integration of ML/AI into practical uses. Upon graduation, I hope to use my skills in a professional environment."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"In 2019-2020, I campaigned to represent Canada in the Summer 2020 Olympics for Mens 470 Sailing. Unfortunatly, due to COVID-19 and school, my goals were put on hold while I have decided to focus on school during this time. My campaign was an incredible learning opportunity that taught me a lot about team work and organization. This sport is done with a team of two which requires efficient and effective communication which came through countless hours of hard work and training. The campaign process taught me the skills I need to perservere through hardships and situations I had thought to previously be impossible. Although this experience did not involve the professional technical skills, I was able to grow as critical thinker and dedicated worker.
